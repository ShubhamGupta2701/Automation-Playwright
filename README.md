#### Difference between Re-declaration and Re-assignment
- Re-declaration : 
    var greet = "Hi"
    var greet = "Hello there!"  // Here we are Re-declaring the variable

- Re-assignment :
    var greet = "hi"
    greet = "hi there!"  // Here we are just assigning a new value to the pre-declared variable
